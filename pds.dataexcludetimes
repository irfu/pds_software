# Column 1-2: Beginning & end of time interval as "spacecraft clock count strings" (SCCS),
#             without being compensated for ADC20 group delay. E.g. 1/0376707707.15680.
# Column 3:   ALL_PROBES, P1, P2, P3, 
# Column 4:   ALL_DATA_TYPES, SWEEPS, LF, HF
# 
# See functions LoadDataExcludeTimes, DecideWhetherToExcludeData for syntax and implementation.
#
# NOTE: Times have to be given
# (1) as "spacecraft clock count strings" (SCCS), i.e. using reset counter and false decimals designating a 16-bit number,
# i.e. the same as SPACECRAFT_CLOCK_START/STOP_COUNT in the LBL files, AND
# (2) without considering the ADC20 group delay.
# This is necessary to make the time designations independent of 
# (1) time conversions (SCCS<->UTC; SPICE kernels), and
# (2) the compensation for group delay.
# 
# NOTE: This does not exclude anything from HK, e.g. when excluding an entire macro.
