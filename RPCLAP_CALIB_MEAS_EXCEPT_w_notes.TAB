# Offset calibration exceptions list
# ----------------------------------
# Explicit time intervals for which pds will use specified TM and offset calibrations.
# A default algorithm will be used for other time intervals.
# 
# NOTE: Must specify LBL filenames; not TAB files, and only filenames (no paths). The corresponding TAB file is implicit.
# NOTE: It is possible to specify several time intervals for the same calibration.
# NOTE: The file may have newline=LF or CR+LF.

# On request from Anders Eriksson as interpreted from email 2016-04-07.
# Covers exactly EAR1.
