# NOTE: There is an unknown upper limit to the length of strings. /Erik P G Johansson 2015-12-17
#       The limit has been raised and pds should be able to handle string lengths (incl. CR,LF) up to 1023 bytes. /Erik P G Johansson 2016-01-07
#       Not sure, but my memory tells me that the string lengths referred to is the entire length of each row in this file. /Erik P G Johansson 2016-03-08
# NOTE: Older version of pds (before commit 017971e, 2015-12-17) can not handle ":" in descriptions.
#       Colon in descriptions yields absent quote in pds. /Erik P G Johansson 2015-12-16
#       Updated pds should be able to handle ":" in descriptions.  /Erik P G Johansson 2016-01-07
# NOTE: The quotes are the quotes that end up in the LBL files.
#       If they are wrong, then the LBL files will be wrong. /Erik P G Johansson 2015-12-17
#
# NOTE: Macros are mostly in sorted numeric order, but not entirely. Third digit (of four) = macro version, so it can also make sense to use that
#       as the last character to be used in sorting, i.e. not exactly numeric sorting order. Sorting is inconsistent.
