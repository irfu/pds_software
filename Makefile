#
# dds2rpc 	Reads archive structure and feeds pds (and or a gse)
# 
# pds		Recives data from dds2rpc and converts
#               this into a pds archive
#
# OASWLIB.f 	Was included to get ESA orbit and attitude software
#               as well as time functions. It required lots of
#               fortran libraries to work though. We use
#               the intel fortran compiler 8.0.
#
# NOTE: pds is only written to be run as a 32-bit application. Therefore
# it has to be compiled as 32-bit also on 64-bit systems, e.g. spis 
# and birra, using the gcc -m32 flag.

# gcc options:
#       -Wall
#           This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to prevent the
#           warning), even in conjunction with macros.  This also enables some language-specific warnings described in C++ Dialect Options and Objective-C
#           and Objective-C++ Dialect Options.

#
#       -ggdb
#           Produce debugging information for use by GDB.  This means to use the most expressive format available (DWARF 2, stabs, or the native format if
#           neither of those are supported), including GDB extensions if at all possible.
#
#       -m32
#       -m64
#       -mx32
#           Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit environment.  The -m32 option sets "int", "long", and pointer types to 32 bits, and generates code that
#           runs on any i386 system.
#
#           The -m64 option sets "int" to 32 bits and "long" and pointer types to 64 bits, and generates code for the x86-64 architecture.  For Darwin
#           only the -m64 option also turns off the -fno-pic and -mdynamic-no-pic options.
#
#           The -mx32 option sets "int", "long", and pointer types to 32 bits, and generates code for the x86-64 architecture.
#
#        -o file
#            Place output in file file.  This applies regardless to whatever sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file, an object
#            file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.
# 
#            If -o is not specified, the default is to put an executable file in a.out, the object file for source.suffix in source.o, its assembler file
#            in source.s, a precompiled header file in source.suffix.gch, and all preprocessed C source on standard output.
#
#        -D name
#            Predefine name as a macro, with definition 1.
#            
# NOTE: If one adds debugging info when compiling (gcc -ggdb), then the compiled binary appears to depend on the number of rows, i.e. NOT only on the
# logic/functionality of the code. The executable changes if one e.g. adds/removes comments.
# This is bad if one wants to compile two different source code versions that should have the same functionality and then compare the corresponding
# compiled executables to make sure the two underlying source code versions are really equivalent.
#
# Remove flags for debugging information? Might speed up execution?!
