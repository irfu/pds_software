# Macro exclusion file

# Macros that are included in EDITED, but not in CALIB.
# In calibration mode we do not want to 
# calibrate the calibration data produced by
# the instrument, since that makes no sense.
# 
# All calibration macros to be excluded from CALIB
# should therefore be listed here.
